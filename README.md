# Deep-Fake-Detector
The Fakespot Deepfake Detector will help you sort out text written by humans from text that has been created using AI tools.

**Important Update: Deepfake Detector will shut down on June 26, 2025.**

On June 26, you will no longer be able to use Deepfake Detector. I Reverse Engineered the code for you so it can be saved and maintain by someone else.

The Fakespot Deepfake Detector extension will help you sort out text written by humans from text that has been created using AI tools.
Features:

- Fakespot Deepfake Detector extension makes its simple to use multiple open-sourced detection models to analyze any text you highlight

- Analysis breaks down the results to show you what each model finds. Easily swap models in and out to find the combination that works best for you
    
- Text is only the beginning - Image analysis and video analysis coming soon. After installing the extension, it is simple to highlight any text online and request an instant analysis. Our Detector will tell you right away if the words are likely to be written by a human or if they show AI patterns.

AI detection cannot be 100% accurate, but we continue to improve the Fakespot ApolloDFT Engine to make it as reliable as possible. See more about the reliability of all the engines you have access to with the extension
